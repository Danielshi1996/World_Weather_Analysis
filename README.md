# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn the API request utilizing Open Weather API and Google map API.

## Detail of the project
The coordinate of places are randomly generated using the numpy module. The city and country code are generated using the citipy module. With the city name, API request can be made using the Open Weather API, which returns data in JSON format. The data are then stored in dataframes, and exported as .csv files. In the Vacation_Itinerary folder and Vacation_Search folder, Google Map API was used. Using the coordinate from the previously saved csv file, interactive maps with location pin and routes are generated.
